# Welcome Movie API!

Hi! 

Using this project you can create tokens in Wompi and with that token create a payment source. 
For the tokenization this projects uses the widget](https://docs.wompi.co/docs/en-us/fuentes-de-pago#widget-in-tokenization-mode) provided by Wompi.

# Dependencies


# Installation

- Install bundler `gem install bundler`
- Install gems ` bundle`


## Run app

- Run command
```

When you tokenize your card, this information is sent to the action set in the html form `my_own_process_token`
this action is set as `post "my_own_process_token", to: "subscriptions#create"` in the `config/routes` so you receive a paramater called `payment_source_token` with the token generated in Wompi.

With this token we call the `Wompi::Client` found in `lib/wompi/client.rb` which creates the payment source.

The `Wompi::Client` ask for the acceptance_token and with the acceptance_token and the token from `payment_source_token` creates the payment source as[Wompi's documentation](https://docs.wompi.co/docs/en-us/fuentes-de-pago)suggests .

When the payment source is success the action `create` in the  controller `app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb` make a redirection to
